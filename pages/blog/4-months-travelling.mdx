### Introduction

In early April 2023, after leaving our jobs and moving out of our flat, my girlfriend Lydia and I embarked on a 4-month backpacking trip. Planning along the way, we ended up visiting 9 countries: South Korea, Japan, Fiji, Australia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. We documented the trip on our [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/rosecottabroad/). This post will give shed some light on my favourite bits, the low points and a reflection of what I learnt about myself along the way.

_Our route._

#### Background

I've done my fair share of backpacking over the last 10 or so years. I've done trips around Europe, South East Asia and South America, and like to think I know my way around the hostel life. However, before this trip I'd only ever gone travelling with someone else once before, for my first taste of backpacking in 2015 with a friend from uni. This was also Lydia's first time backpacking, and as anyone who's been backpacking will know, it's not a holiday. Things regularly go wrong, you have to be flexible with your plans, worry about mundane things like laundry and not catching malaria, and getting used to being without your home comforts, friends and family for an extended period of time. Whilst this uncertainty isn't attractive to everyone, it is a valuable lesson in embracing the unknown and building confidence in knowing that whatever happens, it will probably be alright. Travelling is a beautiful but daunting freedom. I'm grateful to have the means (and a passport!) that allows me to do it.

### Best Bits

#### Tropical Paradise üå¥

Fiji was my favourite place we went to. It's like nowhere else I've been. It's so remote, beautiful and has a unique, friendly and vibrant culture (where else would airline staff sing you a song on arrival?) We spent a week in two resorts on the golden sands of the Yasawa Islands, nestled in the thick jungle and surrounded by turquoise seas. Our days were spent lazing around in hammocks, swimming, snorkelling and paddle-boarding in the sea, eating our meals in the resort restaurants, playing volleyball, stargazing at the clear night sky, watching sunsets and taking part in some of the activities that the resorts offered, such as sunset tubing, learning about coconuts and visiting nearby caves. It's so far from home that we would never go there in holiday, so I'm grateful to have the opportunity to visit.

#### Learning to Dive ü§ø

I'd never dreamed of scuba diving before this trip, but over the last couple of years I've made a conscious effort to push myself to do things that scare me. After getting to grips with snorkelling (which I'd never done before either!), and with Lydia's encouragement, I did an intro dive in our first resort in Fiji. I found it scary but exhilarating. The first breath underwater was incredible and despite spending most of the time either floating to the surface or sinking to the ocean floor, I was keen to do more.

I then did my Open Water certification including 6 dives in Phuket, Thailand, and 7 more dives in Indonesia. I saw some incredible marine life: schools of fish, reef sharks, turtles, squid, octopus and the highlight, manta rays. I also dived the USAT Liberty, an American cruise liner used as a transport that was torpedoed by the Japanese in WW2. Diving has opened up a new world to me, and I'm grateful that I conquered my fears and gave it a go. Once you get the hang of buoyancy control, the sensation of weightlessness underwater is a beautiful and meditative experience. I've got plans to do my advanced course, and to dive whenever possible!

#### Fancy Dress Go Karting on the Streets of Osaka üèéÔ∏è

This was my favourite thing we did, and something I'd wanted to do since my first trip to Japan in 2017. It was one of those experiences where the whole time I had a huge grin on my face and I was thinking "I can't believe I'm doing this". We were driving in traffic, around the centre of Osaka and hitting speeds of around 40mph on the main roads. I didn't envy our guide, who's navigation and photography skills were equally impressive! We'd originally planned on doing it in Tokyo, but when we arrived in Japan we realised that advanced planning for tours was more essential than we thought. Luckily they still offer it in Osaka, and despite it being rained off on the day we booked, we postponed our train to Hiroshima and went back the next day. There was a range of costumes to choose from, and we chose Winnie-the-Pooh and Pikachu. Surprisingly, the locals love it, and we received plenty of waves and laughs as we went round.

#### History and Wildlife üìúüêä

We tried to learn as much as we could about the countries and cultures we visited. We went to museums on everything from local history and war, to festivals, food and even ghosts. We did tours of demilitarised zones, old military bases, ancient temples, spice gardens and a millennia old rainforest, and visited sites of torture and mass genocide in Cambodia. We particularly enjoyed the Australian wildlife. We saw koalas, crocodiles, cassowaries, emus, wallabies, kangaroos, migrating humpback whales and even dolphins coming in on the surf.

This was one of my favourite things about the trip. Learning about events that shape a country and culture from their point of view changes your perception of those events, and is often different to how they are presented at home. I love fitting that new information on world history into what I already know. It's also interesting to see how people in that country live, and how their lives differ from ours.

#### Cooking Classes (and Food) ü•ò

Eating the local food was a big part of our trip. We found cooking classes a great way to learn about a country's cuisine and the cultural elements of their food. We did them together in Vietnam, Bali and Malaysia, and Lydia did one in Thailand whilst I was diving.

Our Vietnamese one in Hoi An was an experience. It first involved a trip to the morning market (Vietnam's food safety standards leave a lot to be desired) and a round-bottomed boat ride (hot, sweaty and accompanied by full volume party music). We then cooked and ate 4 excellent courses including some Vietnamese staples: pork and shrimp summer rolls, papaya beef noodle salad, banh xeo (a rice pancake and one of Lydia's favourites) and beef pho. I even did my first flambe!

The Balinese one was food-wise the worst, but an interesting cultural experience. We did it in a wet Ubud, and after a 45 minute drive to go about 10 miles (typical for Bali) we arrived at a traditional Balinese family home with the cooking school upstairs. The 8 courses all merged into one, Balinese food uses a lot of sweet soy sauce and our chef was quite liberal when adding it to our dishes. The food was also then all combined and we ate it buffet style, which made seasoning our own food pointless. The highlight was the dessert we made called klepon, steamed pandan rice balls with palm sugar inside.

Our Malaysian cooking class was the pick of the bunch. We did it in Penang's Tropical Spice Garden, and had a fascinating tour of that beforehand. We then made beef rendang, an okra salad and pandan rolls for dessert. It was exceptionally tasty and we ate it family style, which rounded off the whole experience.

We ate so much incredible food that it needs it's own blog post. But our highlight was Hida beef in Takayama, Japan. It comes from a specific breed of Japanese black cattle (writing this, I learnt that 'waygu' literally means Japanese cow). After trying it at a street food market, we treated ourself to a lunchtime donburi at a pretty fancy restaurant. It was incredible, and easily the best meal we ate all trip. It was buttery, succulent and melted in the mouth, and we savoured every mouthful. Interestingly, it doesn't seem to be widely available even in Japan!

#### Sharing the Experience üíë

The best part of the trip was sharing it with Lydia. We did so many incredible things together (I have another draft blog post that I decided was too long!). We were there to support each other through the lows, and even the mundane things like sitting in the airport, doing laundry and finding places to eat were made better by having someone to share them with. Spending almost every waking moment together was intense at times, but it has strengthened our relationship. We'll always have those memories we made together, when it was just us with no commitments other than to see the world.

### Worst Bits

#### Food Poisoning üò∑

For the first 8 weeks of our trip we visited mostly developed countries: South Korea, Japan, Fiji and Australia. However, once we hit South East Asia every meal became a gamble. I had two bouts of food poisoning. One in Vietnam from (I suspect) fish, where I had a fever for a day and diarrhoea for about a week, which was eventually cleared up by a cascade of cheap pills from an Hanoi pharmacy. The second one was near the end of our time in Bali, where I succumbed to the notorious 'Bali belly'. I won't go into the graphic details of it, but it involves the worst taxi ride of my life, entire body clearance, being put on an IV during a honeymoon spa package, a ¬£400 hospital bill and about a week of eating nothing but plain rice. Not ideal!

#### Bumpy Boats and Turbulent Planes üåä

I never used to get motion sickness, but we had two very choppy boat rides in Australia and Indonesia that really put me about. The worst one was when were crossing the Lombok Strait from Gili Trawangan (Gili T) back to Bali. The Lombok Strait is the deepest strait in the world, and is notorious for rough conditions. The boats had been cancelled for the 3 days due to high waves, meaning we'd spent an extra night on the island. Before getting the boat, we first had to negotiate a very busy port with a backlog of other travellers. Gili T has a single jetty about 3 metres wide that goes out to concrete dock. It was packed and it took us a good hour and a half of shuffling through the crowds to make the 20 metre trip to the end. Almost all the boats that do the journey are 'fastboats', which do the trip in about a third of the time as the ferry but are much smaller. We had a calm first 20 minutes or so, but once we hit the strait it got very rough. We had waves crashing into the windows on our side above head height, which was terrifying. We made it in the end, but it's fair to say we won't be doing that trip again anytime soon.

We had a few turbulent flights. But the worst one was from Jakarta, Indonesia to KL, Malaysia on Batik air (a Malaysian/Indonesian budget airline). Let's just say the pilot was taking the term 'descent' a bit too literally. That feeling when your stomach drops is all fun and games on a rollercoaster, but not in a little metal box in the sky!

#### Travel Fatigue üò¥

Four months away from home, only spending a few nights in each place, took its toll on us both mentally and physically. By the end of the trip we were ready to come home. It's hard to escape the feeling like you should be doing something every day, because you're in a new and undiscovered place. We started to miss our home comforts, in surroundings that you know well enough to fully relax. Eating out for every meal also gets old, and I was keen to cook and eat my own meals (especially after Bali belly). That being said, the pros still outweigh the cons, and we have plans for another trip in the near future.

### Deep Bits

#### Overcoming Anxiety

The unknown has always made me anxious. I get scared about new places, people and situations, but I know that once I'm used to them the anxiety will pass. My first few backpacking trips gave me a crash course in getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. At home, you can always escape to a safe and comfortable space. That safety is hard to find when travelling. As is typical of backpackers, my previous trips have involved their fair share of heavy drinking. I've realised that alcohol numbed those anxious thoughts and feelings and made it easier for me to make friends, plans and deal with difficult situations.

However, this trip was different in that I barely drank due to an ongoing stomach issue. I had to rely on courage, acceptance and Lydia to get me through those anxious moments. I feel much better off for it, I feel like it was me who conquered all those things, rather than a drunken spectre of my true personality. It's shown me that I do have the confidence and the ability to push myself to do new things, and whilst I still get those anxious flutterings in my chest, they don't have to hold me back.

The biggest example of this was going from being too scared to go out on the snorkel boats to see manta rays in Fiji, to scuba diving with them in Indonesia. In our first resort in Fiji, they blow a conch if they've been sighted and all the guests grab snorkel gear and run to the boats. I knew I wanted to do it, but fear held me back. I then felt the sinking regret of not being brave enough to push through that barrier. To go from that feeling, to the elation of diving with them in Indonesia, having learnt to dive and dealt with lots of new people and situations along the way is an example of personal growth that will stay with me for a long time.

#### Acceptance

As I wrote in the introduction, when you're travelling for an extended length of time things are bound to go wrong. Being able to accept what I can't control is one of the key things that backpacking has taught me. Getting upset, angry or disappointed when something doesn't go to plan is natural, the important thing is what you do afterwards. Going through difficult experiences is a way of developing those skills (Stoic philosophy calls this 'voluntary hardship'.) You never know what you're capable of until you push yourself!

I also had to accept that we couldn't do the perfect trip. This meant getting over the fear of missing things, or not spending enough time in a place. As we were planning our next stops about 2 weeks in advance, we were making decisions on where to go based on cost, reviews and what we wanted to do when we were there. Looking back, I'm proud of what we managed to fit in and what we were able to see, but I do feel like we could've slowed down in some places and had time to really switch off (something I really struggle with!)

#### Travelling Solo vs Travelling as a Couple

I love solo backpacking. My first solo trip to South East Asia in 2016 had a huge impact on who I am and where I've got to today. It gave me a lot of confidence and developed my ability to overcome fear and anxiety as I've mentioned above. There is also something beautiful about being able to recreate yourself when meeting new people in every stop along the journey, and in having full autonomy as to what you do and where you go. I've met some incredible people and made friends for life whilst travelling solo, but there have equally been some lonely and difficult moments that I've had to deal with on my own.

Travelling as a couple is very different, you've got someone with you who you (hopefully) get on with and who knows you deeply. But you've also got to take their needs and wants into account when deciding what to do and where to go. There isn't the need to meet new people as there is when you're travelling solo. On this trip, it took me a while to get over the drive to talk to new people and the feeling that I've failed if I haven't conquered my fears to strike up a conversation with someone new. As I've mentioned above, I loved sharing the journey with Lydia. I'm glad I had those experiences travelling alone, but I'm also happy to leave that part of my life behind. I've realised that as I'm getting older I'm becoming less keen on the hostel lifestyle of constant boozing and sharing a room with strangers. I'm enjoying the stability of a relationship, a routine and sharing my life with people I love. Our trip acted as a good life barometer, and I'm looking forward to whatever comes next!
