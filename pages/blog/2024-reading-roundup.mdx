### Introduction

2024 was an excellent year for me. I settled into a challenging but fulfilling job after a mini career crisis early in the year, went on several adventurous holidays (skiing, scuba and a trip to Albania!), had many new experiences (including gliding over the Peaks, driving supercars and having major surgery), watched a lot of live sport and settled into a regular rhythm of life after last year's traveling exploits.

I've also continued to read, despite buying a Steam Deck and rediscovering a love for gaming. In 2024, I read [59 books (24,334 pages)](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/22312452), at a decent average of 429 pages per book. I've also felt more at ease with not pushing myself to read, which was part of my 2024 goal to avoid burnout.

This post goes over my top 10 books from 2024, 5 fiction and 5 non-fiction. As usual, I have one fiction and one non-fiction book on the go at once, I track my reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22312452-simon-rose) and I tend to find new books on there, by asking ChatGPT or Perplexity or by browsing the shelves in Waterstones.

There's also a bonus 'gaming' section for my favourite game I played in 2024.

Let's get started...
