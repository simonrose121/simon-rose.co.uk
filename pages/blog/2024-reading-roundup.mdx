### Introduction

In the Year in Books tradition of giving a quick summary of my year, 2024 was an excellent one. I settled into a challenging but fulfilling job at [Oak National Academy](https://www.thenational.academy/) after a mini career crisis early in the year. I went on several adventurous holidays (skiing, scuba diving and a trip to Albania!). Had a handful of new experiences (gliding in a motorless plane over the Peaks, driving supercars and having major surgery). And finally, watched a lot of live sport and generally settled into a regular rhythm of life after [last year's travelling exploits](/blog/4-months-travelling).

I've also continued to make time to read, despite buying myself a Steam Deck in August and rediscovering a love for gaming. In 2024, I read [59 books (24,334 pages)](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/22312452), with a healthy average of 429 pages per book. I've also felt more at ease with not forcing myself to read, which was part of my 2024 goal to avoid the persistent burnout of the last few years.

This post goes over my top 10 books from 2024, 5 fiction and 5 non-fiction. As usual, I had one fiction and one non-fiction book on the go at once. I tracked my reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22312452-simon-rose) and I tend to find new books on there or by browsing the shelves in Waterstones. I've also got into the habit of having a few options and asking ChatGPT which one I should read next.

Due to my 'media diversification' of this year (aka doing things other than reading), there's also bonus 'Gaming' and 'Film and TV' sections at the end.

Let's get started...

### Non-Fiction

#### The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Caused an Epidemic of Mental Illness - Jonathan Haidt

<ImageLink
	alt="The Anxious Generation book cover"
	src={anxiousGeneration}
	width={150}
	height={200}
	href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/171681821-the-anxious-generation"
/>

In The Anxious Generation, Haidt argues that the the alarming rise in mental health issues in Gen Z has been caused by the rapid integration of digital technology into children's lives. In the prologue, he uses the analogy that with smartphones and social media we're "raising children on Mars", with no idea how this new environment will impact their social, mental and physical development (a similar point could be made about ultra-processed foods). His central argument is that a shift from unsupervised outdoor play to a “phone-based childhood” has led to increased anxiety, depression, and social isolation. As a solution, Haidt suggests delaying smartphone and social media usage (until 16 if you're interested), phone-free schools and promoting unsupervised play where children can (and should) take risks and test their limits without an adult watching.

I was on the cusp of a "phone-based childhood", with most of my teenage years spent on MSN or playing Xbox Live with friends. This was just before, in roughly 2010, Big Tech worked out how to make their products seriously addictive, with minors being particularly vulnerable to the techniques used (Snapchat streaks, anyone?) It's a terrifying prospect to raise children in a society where it's safer than ever to be outside, but emotional and social development is tied to a handheld device controlled for profit. As Haidt argues, we should raise our children on Earth first before sending them to Mars.

> "We are overprotecting our children in the real world while underprotecting them online."

> "Experience, not information, is the key to emotional development."

> "Gen Z became the first generation in history to go through puberty with a portal in their pockets that called them away from the people nearby and into an alternative universe that was exciting, addictive, unstable, and—as I will show—unsuitable for children and adolescents."

> "Stress wood is a perfect metaphor for children, who also need to experience frequent stressors in order to become strong adults."

#### Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will - Robert Sapolsky

<ImageLink

	src={determined}

	href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83817782-determined"
/>

Determined explores the concept of free will through the lens of neuroscience and behavioral biology research. Sapolsky presents compelling evidence to suggest that our behavior is determined by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and neurobiology, with no room in there for 'us' to actually decide to do something.

His well presented argument has serious implications for traditional notions of autonomy and responsibility (particularly in our justice system). What if you never really 'decide' to do anything? Instead, all actions are caused by your genes, your hormone levels this morning, something that happened to you as a young child, or as an adolescent? This goes against how it 'feels' to make a decision in the moment, but us humans are masters of fooling ourselves.

A few books I've read over the years make sense through this paradigm (e.g. [Unprocessed by Kimberley Wilson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75582857-unprocessed), which nearly made the top 10 this year). From a biological perspective, our self-control, intelligence, and social and emotional development are all dependent on our brain structure, which can develop differently based on a multitude of factors outside our control. If our decision-making arises only from our biology, as Sapolsky argues, then there is no room for free will.

Without getting too political, from a societal perspective, it then becomes society's duty to give every child the best possible chance (through good nutrition, eradicating poverty, etc.) to develop a healthy brain. It's not your fault if you're born poor, and it's not your fault if you die poor either.

> "You cannot decide all the sensory stimuli in your environment, your hormone levels this morning, whether something traumatic happened to you in the past, the socioeconomic status of your parents, your fetal environment, your genes, whether your ancestors were farmers or herders. Let me state this most broadly, probably at this point too broadly for most readers: we are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and environmental luck, over which we had no control, that has brought us to any moment."

> "In order to prove there’s free will, you have to show that some behavior just happened out of thin air in the sense of considering all these biological precursors. It may be possible to sidestep that with some subtle philosophical arguments, but you can’t with anything known to science."

> "It’s impossible to successfully will yourself to have more willpower. And that it isn’t a great idea to run the world on the belief that people can and should."

#### Meditations for Mortals: Four Weeks to Embrace Your Limitations and Make Time for What Counts - Oliver Burkeman

<ImageLink
	alt="Meditations for Mortals book cover"
	src={meditationsForMortals}
	width={150}
	height={200}
	href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205363955-meditations-for-mortals"
/>

Meditations for Mortals is much along the same lines as Four Thousand Weeks, which made [my top 10 in 2022](/blog/2022-reading-roundup). Structured as 28 short chapters (meant to be read one a day for 4 weeks, advice I did not follow!), Burkeman continues his crusade against the notion of 'super-productivity', the idea that every minute should be filled with something productive, that everything should be optimised and that we should be doing 'hard' things all the time.

Burkeman's classification of an "insecure overachiever" resonated with me. I'm someone who sees the day as productivity debt, a never-ending list of items I need to get done before I can 'relax' (spoiler, it never ends). For anyone else who struggles with this, Meditations for Mortals is a must read. I also read [Slow Productivity by Cal Newport](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197773418-slow-productivity?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_17) and [Rest by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502354-rest) this year, which have similar themes of letting go, being finite and getting more done by 'doing' less.

> "We feel pressured to do something extraordinary with our lives, or to an extraordinary standard of merit, or in a way that’s applauded by an extraordinary number of people – even though it’s true by definition that only a few people can ever be extraordinary in any given domain. (If we could all stand out from the crowd, there’d be no crowd from which to stand out.) Why shouldn’t an anonymous career spent quietly helping a few people get to qualify as a meaningful way to spend one’s time? Why shouldn’t an absorbing conversation, an act of kindness, or an exhilarating hike get to count? Why adopt a definition that rules such things out?"

> "The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook."

> "Facing up to reality – as finite humans must – means facing up to the reality of your moods, desires, and interests, too. This is why it takes courage to ask yourself the question that I suspect all those gurus promoting the ‘warrior mindset’ and ‘mental toughness’ are too frightened to ask themselves: How would you like to spend your time today?"

#### Less Is More: How Degrowth Will Save the World - Jason Hickel

<ImageLink
	alt="Less is More book cover"
	src={lessIsMore}
	width={150}
	height={200}
	href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53328332-less-is-more"
/>

Less Is More challenges the notion of "growthism", the pursuit of growth for it's own sake. It begins with a scathing and well-researched critique of the foundations of capitalism: the rise of dualism (the idea we humans are not part of nature), the appropriation of land and resources, artificial scarcity, the requirement for overconsumption, and the obsession with GDP, a metric that it's own creator said should never be used to indicate welfare. The second half of the book then discusses ways to address these shortcomings, with a focus on degrowth, equality, meaningful life and accepting our place back within the natural world.

Less is More has given me a greater understanding of the foundations of our economic system and the inequality and underhand tactics required to feed it. It left me feeling powerless, as the majority if Hickel's suggestions are policy-level, but I did come away with a better idea of how to live a meaningful life in a world of mass-advertising and over-consumption, and a solid skepticism of growth for the sake of growth.

> "All living organisms grow. But in nature there is a self-limiting logic to growth: organisms grow to a point of maturity, and then maintain a state of healthy equilibrium. When growth fails to stop – when cells keep replicating just for the sake of it – it’s because of a coding error, like what happens with cancer. This kind of growth quickly becomes deadly."

> "All of this upends the usual story that we’re told about the rise of capitalism. This was hardly a natural and inevitable process. There was no gradual ‘transition’, as people like to assume, and it certainly wasn’t peaceful. Capitalism rose on the back of organised violence, mass impoverishment, and the systematic destruction of self-sufficient subsistence economies."

> "When people live in a fair, caring society, where everyone has equal access to social goods, they don’t have to spend their time worrying about how to cover their basic needs day to day – they can enjoy the art of living. And instead of feeling they are in constant competition with their neighbours, they can build bonds of social solidarity."

#### The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz - Erik Larson

<ImageLink
	alt="The Splendid and the Vile book cover"
	src={theSplendidAndTheVile}
	width={150}
	height={200}
	href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51187948-the-splendid-and-the-vile"
/>

The Splendid and the Vile tells the incredible story of Winston Churchill's first year as prime minister from May 1940 to May 1941. Dealing with Nazi Germany at it's most beligerant, the fall of France, the evacuation from Dunkirk, the wartime evasion of the USA, the Battle of Britain and months of nightly bombing during the Blitz. It's written using open-secret intelligence reports and private diaries, and creates a vivid portrait of Churchill as the last bastion of freedom against Hitler.

I find World War 2 fascinating. The multitude of causes, the global scale and it's lasting impact, as well as the classic good vs evil narrative. Unlike the other non-fiction books in this list, I didn't make any notes. I was engrossed in Larson's storytelling, fast-paced chapters and the depth of detail that made me feel like I was leading the fight against the Nazis myself. Interestingly, written between the lines is Britain's massive wealth inequality of the time, with nepotism, country estates, debutant balls and seemingly endless champagne is a mainstay of leadership circles. That being said, it's a must read for an insight into one of the 20th century's most important people.

> "Never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few."

> "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat."

> "'I never gave them courage,' he said. 'I was able to focus theirs.'"

> "One young boy, asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, a fireman or pilot or such, answered: 'Alive.'"

### Fiction

#### The Covenant of Water - Abraham Verghese

<ImageLink

	width={150}
	height={200}
	href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180357146-the-covenant-of-water"
/>

The Covenant of Water tells the story of a Malayali family living in Kerela, India. It's a fascinating tale of human relationships and cultural development, spanning three generations of the family from 1900 to 1977. The story revolves around 'the condition', an affliction that causes several members of each generation to drown. It's excellently written, with Verghese drawing on his medical knowledge (he's also a physician) and his family history to weave a vivid and engrossing story. It's an area of the world that I didn't know much about before reading, which has been a theme of my fiction choices this year. Kerala is firmly on the travel list now.

I also read [Cutting for Stone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3591262-cutting-for-stone) this year, which whilst also a great read, wasn't quite as good.

#### The Dark Forest - Liu Cixin (translated by Joel Martinsen)

<ImageLink

	width={150}
	height={200}
	href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest"
/>

The Dark Forest is the second book in the [Remembrance of Earth's Past](https://www.goodreads.com/series/189931-remembrance-of-earth-s-past) trilogy, which I read pretty much back-to-back this year. It's my new favourite science fiction series, and The Dark Forest is my favourite book from the three. It follows the on from [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem), with Earth on the brink of alien invasion. It's an incredible combination of scientific exploration, cultural development and a philosophical exploration of humanity's place in the universe.

It's worth mentioning here that about half way through the year, I started making a conscious effort to avoid books by American authors or set in the USA. The US has a monumental cultural impact on the UK. We're bombarded with American ideals, both good and bad, through our media and the English-speaking news. Originally written in Chinese, the Remembrance of Earth's Past series offers something profoundly different from Western sci-fi. An albiet translated insight into modern Chinese literature and a world beyond hyper-individualism.

> "Ten thousand times the web could be destroyed, and ten thousand times the spider would rebuild it. There was neither annoyance nor despair, nor any delight, just as it had been for a billion years."
