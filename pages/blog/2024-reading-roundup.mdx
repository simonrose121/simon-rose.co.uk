### Introduction

2024 was an excellent year for me. I settled into a challenging but fulfilling job after a mini career crisis early in the year, went on several adventurous holidays (skiing, scuba and a trip to Albania!), had many new experiences (including gliding over the Peaks, driving supercars and having then recovering from major surgery), watched a lot of live sport and settled into a regular rhythm of life after last year's traveling exploits.

I've also continued to read, despite buying a Steam Deck and rediscovering a love for gaming. In 2024, I read [59 books (24,334 pages)](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/22312452), at a decent average of 429 pages per book. I've also felt more at ease with not pushing myself to read, which was part of my 2024 goal to avoid burnout.

This post goes over my top 10 books from 2024, 5 fiction and 5 non-fiction. As usual, I have one fiction and one non-fiction book on the go at once, I track my reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22312452-simon-rose) and I tend to find new books on there, by asking ChatGPT or Perplexity or by browsing the shelves in Waterstones.

There's also a bonus 'gaming' section for my favourite game I played in 2024.

Let's get started...

### Non-Fiction

#### The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Caused an Epidemic of Mental Illness - Jonathan Haidt

/>

In The Anxious Generation, Haidt argues that the the alarming rise in mental health issues in Gen Z has been caused by the rapid integration of digital technology into children's lives. In the prologue, he uses the analogy that with smartphones and social media we're "raising children on Mars", with no idea how this new environment will impact their social, mental and physical development (a similar point could be made about ultra-processed foods). His central argument is that a shift from unsupervised outdoor play to a “phone-based childhood” has led to increased anxiety, depression, and social isolation. As a solution, Haidt suggests delaying smartphone and social media usage (until 16 if you're interested), phone-free schools and promoting unsupervised play where children can (and should) take risks and test their limits without an adult watching.

I was on the cusp of a "phone-based childhood", with most of my teenage years spent on MSN or playing Xbox Live with friends. This was just before, in roughly 2010, Big Tech worked out how to make their products seriously addictive, with minors being particularly vulnerable to the techniques used (Snapchat streaks, anyone?) It's a terrifying prospect to raise children in a society where it's safer than ever to be outside, but emotional and social development is tied to a device in their pocket. We should raise our children on Earth first before sending them to Mars.

> "We are overprotecting our children in the real world while underprotecting them online."

> "Experience, not information, is the key to emotional development."

> "Gen Z became the first generation in history to go through puberty with a portal in their pockets that called them away from the people nearby and into an alternative universe that was exciting, addictive, unstable, and—as I will show—unsuitable for children and adolescents."

> "Stress wood is a perfect metaphor for children, who also need to experience frequent stressors in order to become strong adults."

#### Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will - Robert Sapolsky

/>

Determined explores the concept of free will through the lens of neuroscience and behavioral biology. Sapolsky presents compelling evidence to suggest that our behavior is determined by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and neurobiology, with no room in there for 'us' to actually decide to do something.

This view has serious implications for traditional notions of autonomy and responsibility (particularly in our justice system). What if you never really 'decide' to do anything? Instead, it's caused by your genetics, or something that happened to you as a young child, or as an adolescent? This goes against how it feels to make a decision in the moment, but us humans are masters of fooling ourselves.

Several books I've read over the last few years make sense through this paradigm. From a biological perspective, our self-control, intelligence and social and emotional development are all dependent on our brain structure, which can differ depending on a multitude of factors that are all out of our control. If our consciousness arises only from our biology, then there is no room for free will.

From a societal perspective, it then becomes our duty to give every child the best possible chance to develop a healthy brain that can make rational and sensible decisions, and to protect the rest of society from those (who through no fault of there own) are without. It's not your fault if you're born poor, and it's not your fault if you die poor either.

> "You cannot decide all the sensory stimuli in your environment, your hormone levels this morning, whether something traumatic happened to you in the past, the socioeconomic status of your parents, your fetal environment, your genes, whether your ancestors were farmers or herders. Let me state this most broadly, probably at this point too broadly for most readers: we are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and environmental luck, over which we had no control, that has brought us to any moment."

> "In order to prove there’s free will, you have to show that some behavior just happened out of thin air in the sense of considering all these biological precursors. It may be possible to sidestep that with some subtle philosophical arguments, but you can’t with anything known to science."

> "It’s impossible to successfully will yourself to have more willpower. And that it isn’t a great idea to run the world on the belief that people can and should."
