On the 11th June 2023, I read my 500th book since setting myself the goal of reading one book a week in January 2016. This post is about why I read, how I’ve managed to keep it up and what I’ve learnt.

### Why do I read?

Despite studying English Literature at A Level, I’d always struggled to find the motivation to read, and also to finish books once I had started. I just wasn’t interested in reading, and didn’t see the point, why would I read when I can play video games or watch films/TV? (often at the same time, but we’ll come back to that later.)

I got through my Software Engineering degree at university by reading just enough to make a start on the topics, then figuring out the rest using trial and error with the help of YouTube videos, friends and eventually the year I spent on placement. I was always jealous of people who could sit and read, and would then be able to explain what they’d read in a logical and succinct way.

This all began to change at the end of 2015. In October of that year, one of my best friends had died of cancer, throwing me into a state that I now realise was survivors guilt. I was also working on my Masters dissertation (as my course was an integrated Masters, I didn’t do a Bachelors dissertation), which required reading and writing at a level that I’d not had to do before. My social media consumption was also changing around this time, and I was consuming a lot of ‘self-help’ content from people like Tim Ferris and Ty Lopez, who were endlessly discussing the importance of reading to improve yourself (in hindsight, this was not good for my mental health and I think people should be very wary of content like this, but that’s for another post!) I read a handful books in the last couple of months of 2015, but didn’t have the discipline to sit and read or get through books at any real pace.

Then in January 2016, my brother told me he was going to attempt to read 52 books that year (1 book a week.) Tom and I have always been very competitive, and this was the catalyst I needed (we learnt to ride bikes on the same day after he did it first and I thought “I’m not having that”). Fast forward to August 2023, and I’ve met that 52 book target each year (and almost doubling it with 101 in pandemic-hit 2020). I’ve managed to keep reading despite the life changes, travelling and changing work commitments of the last 7 and a half years. It has dramatically changed who I am as a person, which I’ll cover in the next section.

### How has it changed me?

#### Knowledge

As I’ve written about in previous reading yearly round up posts, I have one fiction and one non-fiction book on the go at a time. I’ll then switch between them depending on how I feel, which keeps me from ‘grinding’ through a book before I start the next one. My strategy with non-fiction books has been to read as widely as possible and over the years I’ve read books on Philosophy, Astronomy, Business, Finance, Self-help, Memoirs, History, Science and Religion (to name a few!) This has given me a breadth of knowledge that I never would have developed otherwise. It has also given me an appreciation of the complexity of life and the world around us, despite our human instinct to simplify topics into more manageable binaries (right or wrong, good or bad, us and them, etc.) I have developed self-awareness and an appreciation of where I fit on the grand scale of the universe.

Having read so many books, I’m also far more critical than I used to be of arguments made without data to support them. We are surrounded by opinions presented as fact, often made based on anecdotal evidence that is not representative of what actually happens most of the time.

#### Perspective

There’s a theory that the creation of the printing press was an essential precursor to the Enlightenment (without which we would not have all the freedoms we take for granted today.) Before this period, books were a precious commodity as replication was done by hand. This meant that they were only really owned by individuals or institutions that could afford them, who could then gate-keep that knowledge from the masses. The printing press radically changed how ideas, thoughts and perspectives were shared. This meant that for the first time in human history, anyone could see how others saw the world. Even in the 21st century, books are still really the only media that provide such a deep connection, and transfer of ideas, between the author and the reader.

I have found this in my own life, reading has exposed me to many different (and often conflicting) perspectives and opinions. It has made me a much more empathetic person, as I’m able to better see how and why people react to different situations. Reading has also helped me develop my own philosophy, which has helped me to make sense of the world. I think this is particularly important in an age where ‘engagement’ of media (clicks, views, etc.) is the main measure of success. Our inbuilt bias towards ‘outrage’ content means that news outlets and social media get more traction from negative content than positive content, which in turn negatively skews our view of the world. We are constantly shifting our perception of the world based on what we interact with, and having a philosophy that sits above this has been important for me when we’re bombarded with the worst aspects of humanity every time we unlock our phones.

#### Discipline

The main reason I’ve been able to keep reading is that I’ve turned it into a habit. I’m always looking for any opportunity to get out my Kindle and dive into a book, and it doesn’t require any motivation for me to do so. For the first couple of years of reading I would have to put my phone in another room, or I would quickly find myself scrolling through YouTube videos with the book discarded next to me. These days I’m much better at getting into that ‘flow’ state whilst reading, as long as it’s reasonably distraction free.

The rise of algorithm-driven social media over the last few years has made it is increasingly difficult to concentrate on tasks that don’t give us that same fast-paced dopamine hit. It also means we find ourselves back on our phones without really thinking about it. Hours and hours of reading (and meditation) has meant that whilst I’m not immune to this, I’ve been able to dramatically improve my ability to concentrate on a given task, a valuable skill in an increasingly distracted world. This is not without its pitfalls though, I’m now far more aware of when my concentration is split between multiple things. For example if there is a TV on in the background when I’m trying to have a conversation, I’ll find this very distracting and uncomfortable.

#### Behaviour

There are a handful of non-fiction books I’ve read have had a huge impact on how I live my life, beyond the knowledge they contain. I’m a firm believer that who we are is not fixed. We can always improve ourselves, learn new skills and create new habits that can change who we are. For example, I’d never heard of meditation (or not least its practical application beyond Eastern religion) before I read Mindfulness by Mark Williams and Danny Penman in late 2015. Almost 8 years later and it’s become a key part of my daily life. In addition, books on diet and nutrition have changed how and what I eat, and books on human behaviour and psychology have changed how I view the behaviour of other people. That’s not to say that one book will change your life, I’d describe it as an endless funnel that narrows the more you read on a topic (but beware of the Dunning Kruger effect, specifically the Mount Stupid and the Valley of Despair.)

Another area that reading has changed me is work and study. I started my PhD in September 2016 and shortly after I read Deep Work by Cal Newport. The crux of the book is that if you’re doing ‘deep work’ that requires problem solving and original thought, 4 hours maximum a day is average you can do this effectively. I’d always found myself getting burnt out when trying to work deeply for 8 hour workdays, so this really resonated with me. I spent the next 3 years completing my PhD only working 3-4 hours a day. As I’ve moved into professional life this has only deepened. I’ve seen no evidence that people work effectively for a full 8 hour workday, and flexible working hours based on output should be standard across intellectual professions.

#### Writing

Reading so many stories has given me a good understanding of what makes a good one. I can see how sentences should be structured to strike a balance between enabling the reader to understand what is happening, whilst using language to describe the scene sufficiently. This has served me well in my academic career, as well as my unofficial position as proofreader for friends and family!

### How do I do it?

There are three main things that have kept me reading, despite the proliferation and optimisation of more gratifying media.

_1. Accountability - Goodreads, friends and family_
Goodreads has been essential in motivating me to keep reading. The reading challenge feature has kept me accountable to the 52 book target, and I enjoy looking back through what I’ve read, when I read it and the rating I gave it. There is dopamine hit every time I set a book to ‘Read’. I also have friends and family who use it to track their reading, and this provides extra motivation to keep going, as well as an almost endless supply of books to add to my ‘Want to read’ list.

_2. Make it easy - Kindle, a reading chair, peace and quiet_
If you want to form a habit, the task has to be as easy as possible. I read almost exclusively on my Kindle, it’s easy to carry, the battery lasts forever, I can highlight on it and it can hold thousands of books. For the first few years of my reading journey, I bought physical copies of non-fiction books. One of the reasons for this was that I could revisit certain ideas (if you’ve ever seen my book collection you’ll have noticed that each book has sticky notes that denote key sections.) However, after 4 years or so I realised I wasn’t actually going back and reading them, so decided to save space (and money) and switch to Kindle instead.

When I was forming the habit, I would mostly read on one chair in my bedroom without any other distractions. This meant no TV, no laptop and no phone. For me, reading requires silence (or my own music choice that I can zone out). Getting into a book and properly taking in the words means I need to enter ‘flow’ state, which takes about 15 minutes to get into, but only a second to be snapped out of. Everyone is different, but for me peace and quiet is a must if I’m reading.

_3. Fear of failure/FOMO - What better motivator than not wasting your life?_
I believe we only get one life, about 80 years (or 4000 weeks) to live. I want to lie on my deathbed and be proud of mine: the people I loved, the places I went, the work I did and the wisdom I gained. Reading, both for learning and for enjoyment, is a huge part of this. I’m reminded of a favourite quote of mine from A Dance of Dragons by George R. R. Martin: “A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies […] The man who never reads lives only one.”

### Other questions

#### Do I make notes? And do I remember everything I read?

As much as I’d love to remember everything I read, it would be impossible (or at least very time consuming.) If I feel like a book will have a particular application in my life, such as The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel, then I’ll make notes. I either make notes either on the Notes app on my phone, or I’ll convert them into a mind map on Figma. Otherwise, I’ll just try to take some general lessons from a book and fit that in my mental model of the world. It often helps me if I talk about key points in the book with someone, as this solidifies some of the memories and helps me recall it later. As Einstein said “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”

#### What are my favourite genres?

Fiction-wise, I enjoy historical fiction, dystopian and fantasy books, anything that builds a world different from our own. For non-fiction, I enjoy books that explain something I didn’t already know, and that challenge the way I think or act.

#### Do I ever reread books?

Sometimes. I think as I get older I will start to reread fiction books that I’ve enjoyed, and non-fiction books that have had a particular impact in my life. The length and complexity of most books means that you take new things from books when you reread them, whether due to missing things the first time, or being a different person than when you first read them. Also, always taking on new information or trying to imagine new worlds can be a challenge, and having a comfortable book or series to go back to can ease some of this strain.

#### How do I choose what to read? And has that changed over time?

I get my new book ideas from either friends and family, Goodreads, Waterstones website or blog posts. I still follow a general rule that I’ll only read books with above an average 4.0 rating on Goodreads, as long as they have enough reviews that the average isn’t skewed by a handful of good (or bad) reviews. I’ve now read most of the books that get recommended on top 100 blog posts, so I’m always on the lookout for new books or less popular books on topics that I’m interested in.
