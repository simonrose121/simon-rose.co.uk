Thesis Title: Developing Childrenâ€™s Computational Thinking Skills using Programming
Games

Supervisors: Dr Jacob Habgood and Dr Tim Jay

My PhD focused on developing programming skills in primary-aged children, and my research is [regularly cited](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon-Rose). My main output was a programming game called [Pirate Plunder](https://pirateplunder.app), that taught procedural abstraction to children aged 10 and 11. The game is available to play for free and is currently being used by the [Federal Center for Technological Education of Rio de Janeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Center_for_Technological_Education_of_Rio_de_Janeiro) as part of their programming curriculum.

I created several other web applications during my PhD, to test various computational thinking skills. I also taught part of the Computer Science curriculum (Scratch and Excel) to control groups.
